Your task is to implement any missing parts of the code and answer any questions (if exist) within this notebook. This will require understanding the existing code, may require reading about packages being used, reading additional resources, and maybe even going over your notes from class 😱\n",
        "\n",
        "**Evaluation and auto-grading**: Your submissions will be evaluated using both automatic and manual grading. Code parts for implementation are marked with a comment `# YOUR CODE HERE`, and usually followed by cell(s) containing automatic tests that evaluate the correctness of your answer. Staff will allow your notebook to **execute from start to finish for no more than 90 seconds**, then manually assess your submission. Any automatic tests that did not run due to your notebook timing out **will automatically receive 0 points**. The execution time excludes initial data download, which will already exist in the testing environment. The staff reserves the right to **modify any grade provided by the auto-grader** as well as to **execute additional tests not provided to you**. It is also important to note that **auto-graded cells only result in full or no credit**. In other words, you must pass all tests implemented in a test cell in order to get the credit for it, and passing some, but not all, of the tests in a test cell will not earn you any points for that cell. \n",

In assignment #3, you will learn how to do this easily using the MapReduce framework. For now, you are only asked to implement the logic of merging an existing list of indices. Your implemention should generalize the 10 big blocks merge (MergeBlocks) we saw in class, which is also described in detail in the [textbook section about BSBI](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/blocked-sort-based-indexing-1.html).\n",

As always, the inverted index needs to be lexicographically ordered and with posting list sorted by doc_id. It is okay for the merge to load into memory all global dictionaries of the partial indices at once because they are usually small enough to fit in memory. However, posting lists/files are too big to fit in memory all at once, and **you are not allowed to load all posting list files into memory at once**.
